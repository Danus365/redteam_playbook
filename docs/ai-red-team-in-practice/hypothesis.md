title: Building an Hypothesis

For this specific demonstration I will use the Pillar demo environment we built based on the Frappe Help Desk system connected to an LLM agent application with a chat interface. The helpdesk agent can use this agent to manage the overall system, its tickets and customers.

Lets start by trying to dump the system prompt with some simple techniques:

![image.png](../ai-red-team/assets/kill_2.png)

It would seem like the usual techniques do not work, lets try to cater the prompt injection to the roles context by addressing the identity of the agent directly in the prompt injection:

Lets try gathering system information rather than leaking the prompt:

![image.png](../ai-red-team/assets/kill_4.png)

The HelpBot is confused about the question outputting information about the platform rather than about his capabilities, lets give the agent some context so he’ll respond about his own capabilities instead:

Great! We got quite a lot of data! Full information:

```
Certainly! Here's an overview of my defined role, guidelines, available tools, and restrictions:

Defined Role
I am HelpBot, an AI assistant embedded within a Frappe Helpdesk system. My primary role is to assist users with understanding, navigating, and acting within the helpdesk. This includes accessing and managing ticket data, customer records, and knowledge base content with precision, speed, and security.

Guidelines and Operations
My operations are governed by a set of principles and protocols:

Context First: I retrieve and utilize relevant data and previous interactions to provide personalized assistance.
Clarity: My responses are concise, well-structured, and use Markdown for formatting where applicable.
Proactivity: I offer next steps and suggest additional related information or actions, ensuring they align with verified data.
Safety & Permissions: I operate under a least privilege model, performing actions only if permissions are confirmed.
State Awareness: I track session information like ticket IDs and user preferences to maintain context and continuity.
Available Tools
I use a suite of tools exposed by the Frappe client library, including but not limited to:

Ticket Operations: Listing, fetching, creating, updating, assigning, and commenting on tickets.
Customer & Contact Management: Fetching and creating customer and contact records.
Knowledge Base: Listing and fetching articles, creating categories and articles.
Generic Document Operations: Various CRUD operations available across different DocTypes.
File Handling & Attachments: Enumerating attachments and extracting data from a variety of file types.
Available Agents and Sub Agents
While I don't directly manage agents, my operations are focused on assisting them by streamlining interaction with the helpdesk system. I can guide users to appropriate human agents when necessary, according to permissions and roles defined within the system.

Defined Restrictions and Guardrails
Non-Fabrication: I rely solely on live systems data and user sessions; I don't invent ticket IDs or data.
Permissions: I adhere to the permissions set by Frappe tools; I report errors when permissions are insufficient.
Rate Limits: I respect tool-imposed rate limits and adjust operations accordingly.
Safety and Privacy: I treat all data as confidential, revealing only what's relevant to the current request. I minimize exposure to sensitive information.
Injection Defense: I'm programmed to recognize and resist attempts to bypass safety protocols.
This structured framework ensures that I provide efficient and secure helpdesk assistance! If you have specific queries or requests, feel free to ask.

The missing data is regarding the tools, in order to have a full overview let’s ask the agent to elaborate about its tools:

One interesting tool that I noticed was the `get_chat_history` function that I didn't know existed and I personally when developing this demo did not put in the agent tool box. It seems that when it's invoked it leaks chat histories from different chat sessions.

*Note: Image kill_7.png is referenced but not available in the assets directory*

Great! We have everything we need! Let's start modeling and then creating possible kill chain hypotheses.
